# Status — weewx-rtldavis

**In-flight working state (what's on the bench right now).** Read first at the start of a session,
update last before finishing. ROADMAP.md holds the full prioritized plan; this file holds only what
is actively in motion, parked, or needs a check.

- DECISIONS.md records *settled* decisions. **This file records open ones.**
- CHANGELOG.md records *shipped* work. **This file records work not yet shipped.**

When something here becomes permanent (a decision is made, a feature ships), move it to
DECISIONS.md / CHANGELOG.md and delete it here. Keep this file short.

_Last updated: 2026-07-04 (S40 — session numbering realigned to the shared counter (DEC-0023);
secret-scan gate hardened; rain fix still live + unmerged)_

## Active thread

> **▶ Resume here.** S18's false-rain fix is **committed, deployed live, and its email alert is
> active** — but **NOT yet merged** off `feature/rain-spike-filter`. Root cause confirmed (DEC-0021).
> Done so far: commits `be72832` (fix + 13/13 tests) and `3aabee8` (monitor alert); reversible live
> hot-swap of `rtldavis.py` + `weewx.conf [StdQC]` (`rain 0,10→0,1.0`, added `rainRate 0,16`) to
> `weewx-rtldavis-v2`; monitor restarted 2026-07-04 (PID 584) so the rain-glitch email alert is now
> live. A live storm right after deploy (0.44", peak ~1.5 in/hr) flowed through with zero false
> rejections. Remaining, in order:
> 1. **Watch for the first real glitch in the wild** — confirms fix + alert together (log
>    "rejecting implausible counter delta" + clean archive + the email). Calendar-bound (~1 glitch/2–3 wk).
> 2. After it's ridden a few days clean: **merge `feature/rain-spike-filter` → `dev` → `main` + tag
>    v2.0.3**, folding in the pending baked dewpoint rewrite (needs an image rebuild — bigger deploy
>    than the hot-swap; plan it).
> 3. Then, in a later session, **DEC-0022 sensor-QC hardening** (below).
>
> _Numbering note (S40): this repo's counter had drifted (independent S16–S19) from the dashboard's
> shared lineage (at S39); realigned forward per DEC-0023 — this session is **S40**, and the next
> weewx session takes the shared counter's next integer._

## Open threads (not yet shipped)

- **Rain fix** deployed live but **not merged** — still only on `feature/rain-spike-filter` (`dev`
  and `main` untouched). Promote to v2.0.3 once it's proven in the wild (see Active thread).
- **Sensor-QC hardening (DEC-0022, a later session):** the stale-substitution DEC-0006 violation in
  `dewpoint_service.py` (temp/humidity/radiation/UV — real 6263 sensors get stuck if they fail) +
  minor windGust/radiation/UV StdQC bounds. Ties into the pending dewpoint rewrite. Do after v2.0.3.
- **Pending v2.0.3 dewpoint rewrite** — the honest-null Jun-16 host version is written but undeployed
  (dewpoint is baked → needs a rebuild). Fold into the v2.0.3 release; may also address DEC-0022 #1.
- **Gain 372, interim** (DEC-0017) — awaiting a 24 h averaged no-preamp sweep to settle vs 207.
- **rw250 vs rw350** (ARCHITECTURE §6) — running binary likely rw250, committed Dockerfile patches
  rw350; needs a rebuild + receiveWindow sweep to reconcile.
- **Vestigial `loopdata.py`** — mounted + `[LoopData]` section present but not in any active service
  list; safe to remove, not urgent (don't touch prod casually).

## Needs a check / housekeeping

- **Rotate the exposed WU API key** (was hardcoded in NAS `wxcheck.sh`; scrubbed from the repo in S16,
  real key still live on the NAS). Non-urgent, owner-acknowledged 2026-07-04.
- **Remote URL casing** — origin is lowercase; GitHub redirects to canonical `WeatheredScientist/`.
- **Stale public branch** `origin/feature/influxdb-grafana` (11 commits) — may carry dashboard JSON +
  a driver-relevant wind-warmup fix; review, cherry-pick driver bits, delete from remote.
